# Sanyo-Try-IMP-21J-3DO-Fun

Here you'll find some general information about Sanyo's version of the 3DO released only in Japan, the Sanyo Try IMP-21J.

I've uploaded a spreadsheet with the capacitor maps for all four boards in this version of the 3DO. Here is a link to the DigiKey list I created for easy ordering. Note that in order to get non polar caps that actually fit the CD board, I went with smd caps. You can bend the legs to fit through the holes, and even leave the isolator in place.

If you're looking to install a 3DORGB into the Sanyo Try, and you're confused since there doesn't seem to be instructions for only that model of 3DO, then open the folder above.
