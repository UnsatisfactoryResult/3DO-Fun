# Sanyo-Try-IMP-21J-3DO-Fun

Here you'll find some general information about Sanyo's version of the 3DO released only in Japan, the Sanyo Try IMP-21J.

I've uploaded a spreadsheet with the capacitor maps for all four boards in this version of the 3DO. Each board has its own tab in the spreadsheet. There is a fifth tab showing a list of replacement capacitors that I used to recap my own system. There is also a link to a DigiKey list I created for easy ordering. I will also post it below:

If you're looking to install a 3DORGB into the Sanyo Try, and you're confused since there doesn't seem to be instructions for only that model of 3DO, then open the folder above.
