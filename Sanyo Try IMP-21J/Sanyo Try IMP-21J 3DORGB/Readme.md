I'll go into detail more a bit later, but for now you can look at the pictures of my install.

I'm using my own no-cut mini DIN mount that requires the removal of the original S Video and RCA AV outputs. The mini DIN mounts in place of the S Video out, and the 240P switch mounts in place of the composite video out. If you don't mind cutting the case, you can just mount the mini DIN to the RF module location on the main board, and drill a hole through. This model had a provision for the module on the pcb itself, but it was never populated, nor was the case drilled for it.
