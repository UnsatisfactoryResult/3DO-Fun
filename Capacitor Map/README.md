# Sanyo-Try-IMP-21J-3DO-Info

Here you can find a spreadsheet with the capacitor maps for all four boards in this version of the 3DO. Each board has its own tab in the spreadsheet. There is a fifth tab showing a list of replacement capacitors that I used to recap my own system. There is also a link to a DigiKey list I created for easy ordering. I will also post it below:
